Story:
    A dwarf lying in the forest near to the entrace of a cave. He experiencing the worst hangover in
history and begging you to help him. He lost all his beer in the forest when he wandered back to the cave
drank but now need at least three bottles to use the only remedy he hopes can help even is
this dire situation, the hair of the dog method. He promises his most precious treasure if our hero help him,
a bottle of aged whiskey what is hidden in the labyrinth inside the cave. When the hero try to convince him 
just one bottle beer is enough he explains that according to the theory of contextus dependent memory he can 
only remember the hiding place of the whiskey if he get as drunk again as it was when he burried it.
    After the hero finds three bottles of beer and brings it back to the dwarf he keeps his promise and
tells the place of treasure which is the north-west side of the labyrinth in the very corner. After the hero
finds the place, misses to dig a hole in the very corner but finds a bottle of whiskey anyway. When he finds a 
bottle in the corner too, he starts to suspect that according to the well documented phenomenon of explicit 
memory degradation in long term cases of severe alcohol abuse maybe the dwarf hid more when he was blackout drunk.
    When the hero tries to dig up other places there is whiskey everywhere. So he keeps going inside the maze and wins.
